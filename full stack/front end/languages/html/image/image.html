    The HTML img tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The img tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The img tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The img tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
    <img src="1.jpg" alt="">
</body>
